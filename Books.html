        <h2>Founder's Accents<br>
          August 2013
        </h2>
        <p>Recently Inc published an interview in which I said we'd noticed a correlation between founders having very strong foreign accents and their companies doing badly.<br>

        Some interpreted this statement as xenophobic, or even racist-as if I'd said that having a foreign accent at all was a problem.<br>

        But that's not what I said, or what I think. No one in Silicon Valley would think that. A lot of the most successful founders here speak with accents.<br>

        The case I was talking about is when founders have accents so strong that people can't understand what they're saying. I.e. the problem is not the cultural signal accents send, but the practical difficulty of getting a startup off the ground when people can't understand you.<br>

        I'd already explained that when I talked about this issue with a New York Times reporter:<br>
        But after ranking every Y.C. company by its valuation, Graham discovered a more significant correlation. "You have to go far down the list to find a C.E.O. with a strong foreign accent," Graham told me. "Alarmingly far down-like 100th place." I asked him to clarify. "You can sound like you're from Russia," he said, in the voice of an evil Soviet henchman. "It's just fine, as long as everyone can understand you."<br>
        Everyone got that? We all agree accents are fine? The problem is when people can't understand you.<br>

        We have a lot of empirical evidence that there's a threshold beyond which the difficulty of understanding the CEO harms a company's prospects. And while we don't know exactly how, I'm pretty sure the problem is not merely that investors have trouble understanding the company's Demo Day presentation. Demo Day presentations are only 2 minutes and 30 seconds. With a presentation that short, you can just memorize it at the level of individual phonemes. Most batches we have groups that do this.<br>

        Conversations are more of a problem, as I know from my own experience doing office hours. We talk about a lot of subtle points at office hours. (Even talking on the phone rather than in person introduces a significant degradation. That's why we insist the groups we fund move to Silicon Valley for the duration of YC.) And I know I don't get as deeply into things with the groups that don't speak English well. I can feel it happening; we just can't communicate well enough. And often when I feel it happening, I warn the founders, because most of the people they encounter are not going to work as hard to understand them as I do.<br>

        A startup founder is always selling. Not just literally to customers, but to current and potential employees, partners, investors, and the press as well. Since the best startup ideas are by their nature perilously close to bad ideas, there is little room for misunderstanding. And yet a lot of the people you encounter as a founder will initially be indifferent, if not skeptical. They don't know yet that you're going to be huge. You're just one person they're meeting that day. They're not going to work to understand you. So you can't make it be work to understand you.<br>

        <h2>General FAQs</h2>
        <p>Will you invest in and/or advise our startup?<br>

         I invest in and advise startups through Y Combinator. If you want investment, the way to get it is to apply for our next round of funding. If we fund you, you can have all the advice you want (if not more).<br>

         Sorry, but I can't give advice to every startup that writes to me. It's as much as I can do to keep up with the ones we've funded.<br>

        <br>Can I mirror an essay on my site?

        I'd rather you linked to it instead. I like to keep track of which ones people read, because it gives me ideas of what to write about next. I also like to be able to fix typos.<br>

        <br>Can I include an essay in my school newspaper?<br>

        Sure, go ahead. Please include the url of the original though.<br>

       <br>Can I put a translation into another language online?<br>

       Sure. Please include the url of the original, and send me the url of your translation so I can make a link to it.<br>

       <br>How long does it take you to write an essay?<br>

      Usually about two weeks. What You Can't Say took a month, partly because the topic was so dangerous. How to Start a Startup took a week, because I started it a week before I had to deliver it as a talk. Writing, Briefly was the fastest, at just over an hour.<br>

      <br>Why did the school authorities veto the plan to have you give the talk that became "What You'll Wish You'd Known?"<br>

      They didn't have anything against me specifically, but because I wouldn't be coming from any organization, they wouldn't have any guarantee I wouldn't say dangerous things. Whereas if I came to speak from IBM or the State Department, and told the students they should all go out and try heroin, I'd be fired.<br>

      Which shows one reason public schools lose. A private school would probably have taken the risk, but the administration at a public school has to consider all the fuss parents might make in the worst-case scenario.<br>

      <br>Are any of your paintings online?<br>

      I don't really consider myself a painter. I was trained in painting, but I haven't worked seriously at it for years. For the curious there is one image online. The painting on the cover of ANSI Common Lisp is also one of mine.<br>

      <br>Are you the photographer Paul Graham?<br>

      No, that's a different guy.<br>

      You say in "Taste for Makers" that setting text in sans serif fonts was a mistake. So why do you use them on your site?<br>

      I was talking about books. The resolution of computer screens is much lower.<br>

      <br>Why is the text on your site so narrow? It wastes screen space.<br>

      The aim of web design is not to use all available screen space. It is legibility. Text is most legible with no more than 70 characters per line.
